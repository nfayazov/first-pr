    <h1>Your First JavaScript Pull Request</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>This page will help you get started with your first pull-request to open-source! Open-source is a vast world of some
        of the most intersting software projects that we all have a privelege to access. There are many
        ways to contribute to an open-source project by fixing bugs, (re)writing documentation, updating dependencies,
        or even reviewing pull requests. Many beginners have a hard time getting into open-source because of the
        scope of most projects, which may seem a little intimidating without experience of contributing to open-source. This
        collection of repositories will help you get started on your first open-source contribution. Pick whatever project
        sounds interesting to you, find an issue that you think you can help with, and start coding!</p>
